# Storyboardless iOS Template for XCode 7
An xcode template for creating iOS apps without storyboards.

There's not a lot of info out there on developing for iOS without storyboards. I'll be putting up some basic templates here for getting started. There are a huge number of reasons you might not want to use storyboards but I won't go into them here.

TODO:
- Add some basic helper functions for window management.
- Create different project types (eg. table list view etc).
